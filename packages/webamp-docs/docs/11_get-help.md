# Get Help

If you are having trouble getting Webamp to work on your site, you're welcome to stop by [our Discord](https://webamp.org/chat) and ask for help in the `#webamp` channel, _however_ **we ask that you use the guide below to ensure you are providing enough information to help us help you.**. The more information you can include the more likely someone will be willing to take time from their day to help you.

### Describe the problem you are having clearly

A clear description of the problem you are having is the most important part of enabling someone to help you. Please include:

1. What exactly are you doing when the problem occurs?
2. What do you expect to happen?
3. What actually happens?
4. What have you already tried to fix the problem?

### Include error messages

Check your browser's console. Are there any error messages? Copy/paste the whole message and include it along with your question.

### Include screen shots

In addition to describing the issue you are seeing, help make it unambiguous by including a screen shot or video screen recording of the behavior/error you are seeing.

### Share your code

Is your code somewhere that others can see it? If not, please paste the relevant code into Discord or put it somewhere online where you can share a link to the code. A [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/) can be useful for this.

### Let us try it

Can you make the broken version of your code publicly available somewhere where others can reproduce the issue you are seeing?
