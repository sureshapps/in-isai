Webamp's most advanced feature is its ability to render any classic Winamp 2 skin in the browser. We have gone to great pains to ensure that Webamp renders skins pixel for pixel exactly how they were rendered in the Winamp 2.9. This has enabled Webamp to play a role in Winamp skin preservation by providing a way to keep classic Winamp skins [alive and accessible online](https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/winamp-skin-musuem/) even as the number of people with Winamp installed on their computers dwindles.

You can read more about how Webamp implements skin parsing and rendering in [this blog post](https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/how-winamp2-js-loads-native-skins-in-your-browser/).
