# Hotkeys

Webamp attempts to emulate the hotkeys of the original Winamp. This means that you can control playback and other features of Webamp using your keyboard.

## Enable hotkeys

If you want to display the hotkeys in the Webamp UI, you can pass the `enableHotkeys` option when initializing Webamp:

```ts
import Webamp from "webamp";

const webamp = new Webamp({
  enableHotkeys: true,
});

webamp.renderWhenReady(document.getElementById("winamp-container"));
```

## Easter Egg

Webamp emulates the original Winamp's Easter egg. If you type "nullsoft", letter by letter, pressing `<esc>` after each letter "L" to dismiss the open file dialog, you will toggle Webamp into and out of "Easter Egg Mode". In this mode, a custom skin-defined title bar is shown in the main window.
