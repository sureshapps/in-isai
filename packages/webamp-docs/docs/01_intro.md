# Quick Start Guide

Here is the most minimal example of adding Webamp to an HTML page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="app" style="height: 100vh">
      <!-- Webamp will attempt to center itself within this div -->
    </div>
    <script type="module">
      import Webamp from "https://unpkg.com/webamp@^2";
      const webamp = new Webamp({});

      // Returns a promise indicating when it's done loading.
      webamp.renderWhenReady(document.getElementById("app"));
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
